<h1>Sequence Hunt - Sample Game</h1>
<h2>Difficulty: Easy</h2>

<p>With difficulty set to easy the clues will indicate the 
color associated with the shape.  This makes the determination
of which colors are part of the solution straightforward.</p>

<p>Below is a depiction of a game along with an explanation
of how to read the clues.</p>

<p><em>Note: in the descriptions each try is represented as having 4 positions.  
The positions are numbered from 1 to 4 as presented from left to right.</em></p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Try Depiction</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><img src="../SequenceSampleGame-EasyMode.1.png" height="17" width="87" alt="Entered: yellow, red, blue, green  Clues: yellow and blue diamonds, red triangle, grayed X"/></td>
<td>
<p>The player enters yellow, red, blue and green, in that order.  
The clues report yellow and blue diamonds, a red triangle and a grayed X.</p>  
<p>From this it is known that there is a yellow and blue at the guessed locations 
and that there is a red at a different location.  There is no green.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><img src="../SequenceSampleGame-EasyMode.2.png" height="17" width="87" alt="Entered: yellow, black, blue, red  Clues: yellow, blue and red diamonds, grayed X"/></td>
<td>
<p>Since the yellow and blue were correct, they are repeated in the same positions.  
The red was in the wrong position so it is guessed to be in the position 4.  
Black is guessed at position 2.</p>  
<p>The clues report yellow, blue and red diamonds and a grayed X.  
The diamonds are not a surprise.  The player has 3 of the positions correctly guessed.  
There is no black.  Now the task is to figure out what color is in position 2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><img src="../SequenceSampleGame-EasyMode.3.png" height="17" width="87" alt="Entered: yellow, white, blue, red  Clues: yellow, blue and red diamonds, grayed X"/></td>
<td>
<p>The player keeps the three correct colors/position and guesses white for position 2.  
The player still gets the three diamonds for yellow, blue and red.  So there is no white.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><img src="../SequenceSampleGame-EasyMode.4.png" height="17" width="87" alt="Entered: yellow, yellow, blue, red  Clues: yellow, blue and red diamonds, grayed X"/></td>
<td>
<p>The player keeps the three correct colors and guesses yellow for position 2.  
The player still gets the three diamonds for yellow, blue and red.  So there is no second yellow.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><img src="../SequenceSampleGame-EasyMode.5.png" height="17" width="87" alt="Entered: yellow, red, blue, red  Clues: yellow, blue and red diamonds, grayed X"/></td>
