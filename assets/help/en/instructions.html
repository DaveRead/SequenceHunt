<h1>Objective</h1>

<p><strong>Sequence Hunt</strong> 
requires the player to figure out a sequence of colors.  
Each attempt to guess the sequence is called a <strong>try</strong>.  
There are four to eight (selected by the user) positions and each position may have any one of 
six colors in it (Black, Blue, Green, Red, White or Yellow).  
A color may appear more than once and obviously not all the colors 
will be used in a given sequence.</p><p>The game allows up to 10 
trys to find the sequence.  Each try is represented as a row of 
circles.  In response to a try, the player is provided with 
clues to help identify the correct and incorrect colors and 
positions for that try.  See the <strong><em>Clues</em></strong> 
section for information on understanding the clue meanings.</p>

<h1>Trys</h1>

<p>The player enters a pattern of colors (remember, a color may 
be used more than once) as his or her guess.  Once a color has 
been entered in each position on the row the guess may be 
submitted.  Once submitted, the clues will be displayed.</p>
<p>To enter a color, the player either clicks on one of the 6 
colored circles at the bottom of the board or uses the keyboard 
to enter a letter representing a color.</p>

<center>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Color</th><th>Letter</th></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Black</td><td align="center">K</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Blue</td><td align="center">B</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Green</td><td align="center">G</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Red</td><td align="center">R</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">White</td><td align="center">W</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Yellow</td><td align="center">Y</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>If a mistake is made as the user enters his or her guess, the 
delete key or the delete symbol (see image below) at the 
bottom of the game board may be used to remove the guesses 
(prior to submitting the try).</p>

<p>The try is submitted by 
pressing the enter key or the submit symbol (see image below) at the 
bottom of the game board.</p>

<center>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Image</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><img src="../delete_entry.png" alt="second from the right"/></td><td >Delete entered color</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><img src="../submit_try.png" alt="Rightmost image"/></td><td >Submit try</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<h1>Clues</h1>

<p>Clues are 
reported to the left of each try row.  When a guessed color 
is located in the correct position the clue will be a diamond.  
Therefore, the player's ultimate goal (winning the game) is 
to get all the clues to report a diamond.</p>  
<p>If a correct color 
is used but in the wrong position a triangle is shown.  If the 
color is incorrect then a circle with an 'X' through it is 
shown.  There will be one clue for each position in the sequence.</p>

<h2>Clue Shapes</h2>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Shape</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td valign="center" align="center"><img src="../correct.png" alt="Diamond"/></td>
<td>A diamond indicates that there is a color in the correct position</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="center" align="center"><img src="../incorrect_position.png" alt="Triangle"/></td>
<td>A triangle indicates that the color does occur in the sequence but in a different position</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="center" align="center"><img src="../incorrect.png" alt="Circle with an X in it"/></td>
<td>The circle with an "X" through it indicates that the color does not occur (again) in the sequence</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Depending on the game's difficulty level 
(see the <strong><em>Difficulty Level</em></strong> section) 
the clues appear in one of two fashions.</p>

<h2>Easy</h2>

<p>If the difficulty level is set to <strong>Easy</strong> then 
the diamond and triangle clues will be filled with their 
associated colors.  For example if a red diamond is shown, 
it means that one of the red guesses is in the correct position.  
If a yellow triangle were shown it would mean that a yellow 
guess was in the incorrect position in the row.</p>

<h2>Hard</h2>

<p>If the difficulty level is set to <strong>Hard</strong> then 
the clues are always gray, adding a challenge to figuring out 
which colors and positions are correct and incorrect.</p>

<h1>Difficulty Level</h1>

<p>Use the menu to select <strong>Configure</strong>.  This allows 
the player to switch between <strong>Easy</strong> 
and <strong>Hard</strong> difficulty levels 
(see the <strong><em>Clues</em></strong> section for 
details on the purpose of this setting).</p>

<h1>Sequence Length</h1>

<p>The player may set the sequence length to a value from 4 to 8.
Longer sequences are harder to figure out within the 
10 trys allowed.<p>

<p>To set the sequence length, use the game's menu to select 
<strong>Configure</strong>.  The configuration screen contains a
drop down list, which permits setting the sequence length.
<em><strong>If a game is in progress when the 
sequence length is changed, the old game will end and
a new game will be started.</strong></em></p>
