<h1>Sequence Hunt - Sample Game</h1>
<h2>Difficulty: Hard</h2>

<p>With the difficulty set to hard, the clues will not indicate the 
color associated with the shape.  This makes the determination
if which colors are part of the solution more challenging.</p>

<p>Below is a depiction of a game along with an explanation
of how to read the clues.</p>

<p><em>Note: in the descriptions each try is represented as having 4 positions.  
The positions are numbered from 1 to 4 as presented from left to right.</em></p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Try Depiction</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><img src="SequenceSampleGame-HardMode.1.png" height="17" width="87" alt="Entered: Yellow, Yellow, Red, Red  Clues: Diamond, Triangle and two grayed Xs"/></td>
<td>
<p>The player enters two yellows and 2 reds.  The clues report one diamond, one triangle and two grayed Xs.  
From this it is known that one of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are at least two yellows</li>
<li>There are at least two reds</li>
<li>There is one yellow and one red</li>
</ul>
<p>The player also knows that one of the colors is in the correct position and one is not.  
So, if there are two reds, one is in position 3 or 4 and the other would be in position 1 or 2.  
Similar reasoning can be applied if there are two yellows or a yellow and a red.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><img src="SequenceSampleGame-HardMode.2.png" height="17" width="87" alt="Entered: Yellow, Red, Blue, Blue  Clues: Triangle and three grayed Xs"/></td>
<td>
<p>The player takes a guess that there is one yellow and one red, 
entering one yellow and one red along with introducing a new color, blue.</p>  
<p>The clues report one triangle and 3 grayed Xs.
The player now knows that there must be at least two yellows or two reds 
and that there are no blues.</p>  
<p>This has to be true since the first try 
reported two correct colors (one in the incorrect position) and those 
colors were yellow and red.  Since in this try the player included a 
yellow and a red, at least one of them had to be present.  
Now the player needs to figure out if there are at least two yellows or two reds, along 
with finding any other colors that may be in the sequence.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><img src="SequenceSampleGame-HardMode.3.png" height="17" width="87" alt="Entered: Yellow, Green, Yellow, Green  Clues: Three triangles and a grayed X"/></td>
<td>
<p>The player guesses yellow as the color that was correct in the first try.  
Since the first try reported that one color was in the correct position and 
one incorrect, the player keeps one yellow in position 1 and places the 
other in position 3.  The player includes a new color, green, in positions 2 and 4.</p>
<p>The clues report three triangles and a grayed X.  
This means that the player has found three correct colors, all in incorrect positions.</p>  
<p>The player now knows that there are at least two yellows and one green.  
This is guaranteed since the first two trys proved that there were at least two yellows or two reds.  
If there were two reds then try three could not report three correct colors (there 
would be no yellow and at most the two greens).  Now the task is to figure out the 
correct positions of the known colors (two yellows and one green) and find 
the fourth position's color.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><img src="SequenceSampleGame-HardMode.4.png" height="17" width="87" alt="Entered: White, Yellow, Green, Yellow"/></td>
<td>
<p>From the previous trys the player knows where the yellows have to go.  
Only positions 2 and 4 are options, since there are at least two yellows 
and they are not in positions 1 and 3.  The green is not in position 2 or 4 
so it is either in position 1 or 3.</p>
<p>As a guess the player places the green in position 3.  
Searching for the fourth position/color the player tries a white in position 1.</p>  
<p><em>This turns out to be the correct sequence.</em></p>
